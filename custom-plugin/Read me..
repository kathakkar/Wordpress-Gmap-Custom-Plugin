 A WORDPRESS PLUGIN THAT DOES ALL OF THE FOLLOWING.
- Allows users to manage a custom post type that stores locations. 
- Allows users to drag a marker on a map inside of a custom meta box. When the user saves the location, the pin’s coordinates 
(as well as the map’s current zoom level and bounds) should be saved. This way, 
- if the user comes back later, it looks identical. 
- Allows the location (and all of its information) to be embedded inside of a post or page via the shortcodes API.
